            Create a main page (index.html) representing a professional portfolio, including the following:
<b></b>
            an appropriate <header> element
            a <nav> element linking to each of the sections
            an <h1> element with your page title (there can be only one)
            a <section> element for each of the following, each of which should contain an appropriate heading element:
            About Me, consisting of:
            brief biographical information
            photo
            contact information
            links to your professional networking site profiles, including at least GitHub and LinkedIn
            list of skills
            <b></b>
            Include whatever other information you consider pertinent.
            <b></b>
            Projects, consisting of at least three, each represented as an <article>
            name of project, linked to GitHub repository or the repository/project’s GitHub Pages

            <b></b>
            Don’t worry that your available projects are limited now. You’ll have time to increase the size of your portfolio.
            <b></b>
            an appropriate <footer> element</p>
                <picture>
